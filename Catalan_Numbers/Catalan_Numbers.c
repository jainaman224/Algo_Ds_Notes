/*
    Catalan numbers (Cn) are a sequence of natural numbers that
    occur in many places. The most important ones being that Cn
    gives the number of Binary Search Trees possible with n values.
    Cn is the number of full Binary Trees with n + 1 leaves.
    Cn is the number of different ways n + 1 factors can be 
    completely parenthesized.

        We can see here that Catalan numbers form a recursive
        relation i.e for nth term, the Catalan number Cn is
        the sum of Catalan(i) * Catalan(n-i-1) where i goes from
        0...n-1. We can also observe that several values are getting
        repeated and hence we optimise the performance by applying
        memoization.
