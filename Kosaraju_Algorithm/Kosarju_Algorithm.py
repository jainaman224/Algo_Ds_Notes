# Python implementation of Kosaraju's Algorithm 
# Kosaraju's Algorithm is used to print all Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph
# A component is said to be strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices in it.

# Kosarajuâ€™s Algorithm involves two passes of Depth First Search in order to find the number of SCCs

# defaultdict is useful if one tries to access or modify a missing key. In such a case,
# defaultdict will automatically create the key and generate a default value for it. 
# It handles missing keys well.
