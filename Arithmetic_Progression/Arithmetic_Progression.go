        ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION

        Any sequence of elements where the difference between any two 
        consecutive elements is equal is termed to be in A.P.
        The nth term of an A.P. is defined as (a + (n - 1)*d)
        where a is the first element of the A.P.
        d is the common difference of the A.P.
