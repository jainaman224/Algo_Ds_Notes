# INSERTION SORT

Array or List is divided into two subparts throughout the sorting algorithm i.e. sorted and unsorted part. An element is taken from the unsorted part and is inserted at the correct position in the sorted part and is done till unsorted part vanishes.

## Algorithm
```
Step 1 − If it is the first element, it is already sorted. 
		 return 1;
Step 2 − Pick next element
Step 3 − Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list
Step 4 − Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is 
		 greater than the value to be sorted
Step 5 − Insert the value
Step 6 − Repeat until list is sorted
