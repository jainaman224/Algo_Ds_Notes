# K-nearest neighbors algorithm

## Description:
In Machine Learning, the K-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space.

Here, in the knn.cpp file, we have implemented the above algorithm using C language where the input data is taken from the user and the user can also set the value of K.
