/* Babylonian method for square root
  1. Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the 
     root, the better).
  2. Initialize y = 1.
  3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
      a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
      b) Set y = n/x */
