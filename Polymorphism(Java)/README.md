## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on *many forms*.
The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a *parent class* reference is used to refer to a *child class object*

## Types of Polymorphism

We have **three** types of Polymorphism in Java. Namely,

1. **Method Overriding**

  Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes

2. **Method Overloading**

  If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading

3. **Constructor Overloading**

  Constructor overloading is a technique in Java in which a class can have any number of constructors that differ in parameter list. The compiler differentiates these constructors by taking into account the number of parameters in the list and their type
