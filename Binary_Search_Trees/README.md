# Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the followig properties −

- The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
- The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.

## Example: Construct a Binary Search Tree by inserting the following sequence of numbers

     10,12,5,4,20,8,7,15 and 13

## Basic Operations

Following are the basic operations of a tree −

### 1. Search 
 
 The search operation is performed as follows

- Read the search element from the user.
- Compare the search element with the value of root node in the tree.
- If both are matched, then display "Given node is found!!!" and terminate the function
- If both are not matched, then check whether search element is smaller or larger than that node value.
- If search element is smaller, then continue the search process in left subtree.
- If search element is larger, then continue the search process in right subtree.
- Repeat the same until we find the exact element or until the search element is compared with the leaf node
- If we reach to the node having the value equal to the search value then display "Element is found" and terminate the function.
- If we reach to the leaf node and if it is also not matched with the search element, then display "Element is not found" and terminate the function.T

### 2. Insert 

The insertion operation is performed as follows

- Create a newNode with given value and set its left and right to NULL.
- Check whether tree is Empty.
- If the tree is Empty, then set root to newNode.
- If the tree is Not Empty, then check whether the value of newNode is smaller or larger than the node (here it is root node).
- If newNode is smaller than or equal to the node then move to its left child. If newNode is larger than the node then move to its right child.
- Repeat the above steps until we reach to the leaf node (i.e., reaches to NULL).
- After reaching the leaf node, insert the newNode as left child if the newNode is smaller or equal to that leaf node or else insert it as right child.

### 3. Delete

**Case 1:**  Deleting a Leaf node (A node with no children)

  - Find the node to be deleted using search operation
  - Delete the node using free function (If it is a leaf) and terminate the function.

**Case 2:** Deleting a node with one child

  - Find the node to be deleted using search operation
  - If it has only one child then create a link between its parent node and child node.
  - Delete the node using free function and terminate the function.

**Case 3:** Deleting a node with two children

  - Find the node to be deleted using search operation
  - If it has two children, then find the largest node in its left subtree (OR) the smallest node in its right subtree.
  - Swap both deleting node and node which is found in the above step.
  - Then check whether deleting node came to case 1 or case 2 or else goto step 2
  - If it comes to case 1, then delete using case 1 logic.
  - If it comes to case 2, then delete using case 2 logic.
  - Repeat the same process until the node is deleted from the tree.
  
### 4. Traversal

There are mainly three types of tree traversals.

 ##### 1. Pre-order traversal

  In this traversal technique the traversal order is root-left-right 
  
    - Process data of root node
    - First, traverse left subtree completely
    - Then, traverse right subtree
 
    void perorder(struct node*root)
    {
        if(root)
        {
            printf("%d ",root->data);    //Printf root->data
            preorder(root->left);       //Go to left subtree
            preorder(root->right);     //Go to right subtree
        }
    }
    
    
  ##### 2. Post-order traversal

  In this traversal technique the traversal order is left-right-root.

   - Process data of left subtree
   - First, traverse right subtree
   - Then, traverse root node
   
    void postorder(struct node*root)
    {
        if(root)
        {
            postorder(root->left);      //Go to left sub tree
            postorder(root->right);    //Go to right sub tree
            printf("%d ",root->data); //Printf root->data
        }
    }
    
    
  ##### 3. In-order traversal

   In in-order traversal, do the following:

   - First process left subtree (before processing root node)
   - Then, process current root node
   - Process right subtree
    
    
    void inorder(struct node*root)
    {
        if(root)
        {
            inorder(root->left);        //Go to left subtree
            printf("%d ",root->data    //Printf root->data
            inorder(root->right);     //Go to right subtree
        }
    }
