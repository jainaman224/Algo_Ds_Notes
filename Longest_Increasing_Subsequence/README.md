# Longest Increasing Subsequence<br/>
The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
<br/>
## Complexity
The longest increasing subsequence problem is solvable in time `O(n log n)`, where n denotes the length of the input sequence.
<br/>
Dynamic programming approach has complexity `O(n * n)`.
<br/>
For example-<br/>
the length of LIS for 
> 10,  22,  9,  33,  21,  50,  41,  60,  80 <br/> 


is 6


and LIS is 
> 10,  22,  33,  50,  60,  80
