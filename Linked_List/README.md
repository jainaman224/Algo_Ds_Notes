# Linked List

A [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations (like an array). The elements are **linked** using pointers. Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. 

In basic terms, each element points to the next. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains data pertaining to that node and a reference (address) of the next node. 

Note: This article pertains information about singly linked list.

## Types of Linked List

* Singly linked list
* [Circular linked list](https://github.com/jainaman224/Algo_Ds_Notes/tree/master/Circular_Linked_List)
* [Doubly linked list](https://github.com/jainaman224/Algo_Ds_Notes/tree/master/Doubly_Linked_List)

## Advantages 

* Linked list is a  **Dynamic Data Structure**. Meaning it's size can grow and shrink during runtime. 
* Insertion and Deletion operations are easier as compared to arrays. 

## Disadvantages

* They use more memory than arrays because they use pointers.
* Accessing an element has to be done sequentially, i.e, start from the first node. 
* Nodes are stored incontigously which increases time required to access individual elements.

## Applications

* Implementation of stacks and queues can be done using linked list.
* Music Player: Songs are linked to previous and next song. 
* Implementation of graphs.
* Implementation of hash maps. 
* Performing arithmetic operations on long integers.
