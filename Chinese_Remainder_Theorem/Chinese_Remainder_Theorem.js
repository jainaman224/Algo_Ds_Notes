/*
The Chinese Remainder Theorem or CRT as it is commonly known is used to evaluate the smallest number 'n' such that:
n % numbers[0] = remainder[0],
n % numbers[1] = remainder[1],
..............................
n % numbers[length-1] = remainder[length-1].
CRT belongs to the class of residue number system.
CRT is given by relation n=Î£{s(i)*(remainders(i)*s1_inverse(i))mod divisors(i)}mod M, where:
1. s(i) is partial product.
2. s(i)_inverse is the inverse for partial product.
3. remianders(i) is the remiander set value.
4. divisors(i) is the divisor set value.
5. M is known as the dynamic range

/* 
The inverse element is defined by (s1*s1_inverse)%moduli =1, 
where s1_inverse needs to be evaluated. The below function
is used as helper to find the inverse.
