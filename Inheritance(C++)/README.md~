##Types of Inheritance
We have **5** different types of Inheritance. Namely,

1.**Single Inheritance**
	In this type of inheritance one derived class inherits from only one base class. It is the most simplest form of Inheritance.

2.**Multiple Inheritance**
	In this type of inheritance a single derived class may inherit from two or more than two base classes.

3.**Hierarchical Inheritance**
	In this type of inheritance, multiple derived classes inherits from a single base class.

4.**Multilevel Inheritance**
	In this type of inheritance the derived class inherits from a class, which in turn inherits from some other class. The Super class for 		one, is sub class for the other.

5.**Hybrid Inheritance** (also known as _Virtual Inheritance_)

	Hybrid Inheritance is combination of Hierarchical and Mutilevel Inheritance.
