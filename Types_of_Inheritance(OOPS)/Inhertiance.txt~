Types of Inheritance
We have 5 different types of Inheritance. Namely,

1.Single Inheritance
	In this type of inheritance one derived class inherits from only one base class. It is the most simplest form of Inheritance.
2.Multiple Inheritance
	In this type of inheritance a single derived class may inherit from two or more than two base classes.
3.Hierarchical Inheritance
	In this type of inheritance, multiple derived classes inherits from a single base class.
4.Multilevel Inheritance
	In this type of inheritance the derived class inherits from a class, which in turn inherits from some other class. The Super class for 		one, is sub class for the other.
5.Hybrid Inheritance (also known as Virtual Inheritance)
	Hybrid Inheritance is combination of Hierarchical and Mutilevel Inheritance.
