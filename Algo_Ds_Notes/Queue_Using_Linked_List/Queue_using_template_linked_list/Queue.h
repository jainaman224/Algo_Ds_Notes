 * Class: Queue
 * Usage: Queue<int>
 *        Queue<double>
 *        (Queue<string> is not working as expected)
 * ----------
 * This header defines a generic template for Queue datastructure.
 * genericType is to be provided by the client.
 *
 * Behind the abstraction:
 * Implementation using linked lists where enqueuing and dequeuing
 * both perform without the need for pointer traversals.
 *
 * Enqueue operation is dealt by the tail pointer as adding an element
 * to the end only requires the last pointer
 *
 * Dequeue operation is dealt by the head pointer as removing an element
 * would require the previous pointer to attach the nodes properly. Head
 * node which always points the the first node serves the purpose of a
 * previous pointer
 *
 * TODO: Strings are to be handled well, for some reason a BAD_ACCESS memory error is thrown
