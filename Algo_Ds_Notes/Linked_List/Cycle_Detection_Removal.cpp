/*
Technique used:

This method of detecting cycle is dependent upon Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm.
In Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, we take two pointers : fast and slow.
The algorithm comes to an end when both of these pointers meet at a common point.
Then, we store the address of the common point in a pointer variable (temp here).
We start form the head of the linked list, and check each node if it is reachable
from temp. That particular node, if found, is the starting node of the linked list.
We assign a pointer to the previous one of this node.
