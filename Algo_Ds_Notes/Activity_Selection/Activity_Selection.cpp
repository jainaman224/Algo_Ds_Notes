/*
The problem statement for Activity Selection is that "Given a set of n
activities with their start and finish times, we need to select maximum number
of non-conflicting activities that can be performed by a single person, given
that the person can handle only one activity at a time." The Activity Selection
problem follows a Greedy approach.
