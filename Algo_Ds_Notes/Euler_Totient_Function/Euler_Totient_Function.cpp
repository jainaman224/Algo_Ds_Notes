/*
    Euler Totient Function.

    ETF (Euler Totient Function) of a number n is defined as the number of positive integers
    less than n, which are co-prime to n, i.e. 
    ETF(n) = frequency of x where gcd(x,n) = 1 and 1<=x<=n.

    Brute force approach : Iterate over all elements < n and check if it's co-prime to n.

    Our Approach : We use formula - ETF(n) = (1- 1/p1)*(1 - 1/p2).. where p1, p2 etc are 
                    prime factors of n.
