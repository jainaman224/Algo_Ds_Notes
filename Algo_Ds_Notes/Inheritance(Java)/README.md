# Inheritance

Inheritance is where *derived class* inherits the members (variables and functions) of *base class*.

The benefit of inheritance is that the derived class does not have to redeclare all the members which it inherits from the base class. Hence, reusability is achieved this makes code cleaner.

## Types of Inheritance

We have **three** types of Inheritance in Java. Namely,

1. **Single Inheritance**

	In this type of inheritance one derived class inherits from only one base class. It is the most simplest form of Inheritance.

2. **Hierarchical Inheritance**

	In this type of inheritance, multiple derived classes inherits from a single base class.

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**

	In this type of inheritance the derived class inherits from a class, which in turn inherits from some other class. The Super class for one, is sub class for the other.

### Note

There is no concept of **Multiple Inheritance** and **Hybrid Inheritance** in Java. Derived class can have one and only one base class.
