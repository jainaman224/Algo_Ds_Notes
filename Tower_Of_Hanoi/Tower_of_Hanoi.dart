/* Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical problem where we have three rods A, B and C and n
number of disks where n is taken from user in this code. 
The goal of the problem is to transfer the entire stack of disks to another rod,
obeying the conditions as follows:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing 
it on top of another stack.
3) No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk. */
