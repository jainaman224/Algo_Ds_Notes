/*
    This is the solution for tower of hanoi problem using recursion implemented in Kotlin
    Tower of Hanoi is an application of recursion
    In this our aim is to shift n disks from source tower(peg) to destination tower(peg)
    We can use third tower as auxilary tower. In it's solution we first try to shift n-1 disks.
    Minimum number of steps required for this are 2^n-1 where n is number of disks.
