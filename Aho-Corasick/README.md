# Aho-Corasick
The Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm is a string-searching algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick. It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text.

# Time Complexity
Let there be a set of strings with the total length m (sum of all lengths). The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a data structure similar to a trie with some additional links, and then constructs a finite state machine (automaton) in O(mk) time, where k is the size of the used alphabet.

# Implementation
