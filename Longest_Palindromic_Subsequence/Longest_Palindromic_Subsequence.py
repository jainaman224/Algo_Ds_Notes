'''
    LONGEST PALINDROMIC SUBSEQUENCE
    The task is to find the length of the longest possible subsequence
    of a given word which is a palindrome.
    A palindrome is a string that is same when read from any side.

    We use Dynamic Programming approach to solve this problem.
    A 2D matrix M of size n*n is created where n is the length of the given
    string. Here the row i denotes the char S[i] of the string while column j
    denotes char R[j], where R is the reverse of the string S. Thus, M[i][j]
    denotes the max length of longest common subsequence between the string
    S[0...i] and R[0..j]. Hence M[n][n] will compute the longest common
    subsequence of S[0..n] and R[0..n], which is the required answer.
